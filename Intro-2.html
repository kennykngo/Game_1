            <h2 class="inFront"> "You are the cure.", the hologram says. "However, you are also the cause. 
With the sporadic mutation with your terminal cancer, a new virus was spat out, causing others to be infected and undergoing a state of death, then reliving back as a lifeless corpses, roaming around the ends of the Earths just to eat flesh. We scientists were working day and night trying to contain the virus,  but it got out of our control and has wiped 
around 86.3 percent of the population within 4 days. 
On the 5th day, I got discovered and bitten. Whatever you do, don't look behind you. They will be there."And the holographic video comes to an end, you hear a subtle breathing faintly behind you..it's not close, but it's near. </h2>
