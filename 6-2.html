            <h2 class="inFront"> You grab the crowbar and whack the shiitake mushrooms out of that zombie! Good job! Hmm, you wonder why the cure for the zombie would be so secretive. While walking around, you find another door. Upon opening it, you find the last television screen. It shows the girl that you're with, right behind you..looking at you with those devious eyes. Do you trust what you see? I mean it can't be all that accurate! Trust it?
