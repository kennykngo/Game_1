            <h2 class="inFront"> There's only one button on this TV. You press the button to turn it off and suddenly, a bunch of stairs appear behind the wall. You guys walk down another path, man this gives me the creeps! It's definitely interesting though but you're still questioning why you're here! As you're walking, and you find another room, this person appears to be alive... And sane. He introduces himself, I am the greatest scientist of all time! In fact, I created this disease and this will forever be my best art! Confused as you are, you began to consult the man. He said if you sacrifice yourself, I will help cure the zombie disease! However, if you sacrifice the girl, then it will cure your cancer and you would be able to live longer. No guarantee how long you'll live though.
