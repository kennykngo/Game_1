            <h2 class="inFront"> Left! That's the sweet spot! As you guys walk down a dark and lonely path,this place seems never ending... my gosh. You see a large pile of bones scattered down the hallwayas you shine your light straight down. Man, that's gnarly. You peered back at the girl, she seemed fine for a young girl.You guys walk a bit farther down and discover a roomwith many feet of reinforced concrete. You see many dissected bodies all around... My gosh, what even happened here? So many bodies and so many people went into finding the cure you assumed. You hear a massive growling behind you. Wait, the girl is in front of you..
